# Digit recognition 

Digit recognition is the process of identifying and classifying handwritten or printed digits from images, typically ranging from 0 to 9. It plays a key role in various applications such as handwritten note recognition, check processing, postal code reading, and form automation. The most commonly used dataset for training digit recognition models is the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

# How Digit Recognition Works:
Digit recognition involves using machine learning or deep learning algorithms to recognize and classify digits. Below is an overview of the steps involved:

**1. Data Acquisition:**
In digit recognition tasks, images of digits are usually preprocessed to a standard format (e.g., 28x28 pixel grayscale images in the MNIST dataset). These images serve as input data for training models.

**2. Preprocessing:**
The raw pixel values in the images are typically scaled or normalized to improve model performance. Other preprocessing steps can include:

1.Reshaping images into the required format for the model.
2.Normalizing pixel values to a range of [0, 1].
